This index.html file is built with a responsive CSS system using javascript functions

The code does this:
·When hovering the squares, they turn into circles (not using :hover)
·When clicking them, they lose their outer shadow
·When double clicking them, they lose their outer shadow and receive and inner shadow
·When clicking delete, both the button and the respective square disappear
·When deleted, no space remains between them they move next to each other
·Each of the transformations lasts a second (shadow disappearing, turning into square/circle, disappearing when deleted)
